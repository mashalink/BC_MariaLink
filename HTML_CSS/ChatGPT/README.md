# Reflections on the AI Experiment

This experiment with the AI has been a bit of a mixed experience. At first, I was curious to see how well the AI could create a personal homepage without any manual coding. The AI did produce a basic version, but it was very simple and sometimes seemed a bit silly. The code was functional, but it felt more like a template than something custom.

What I learned is that while the AI can quickly create basic code, it struggles with anything more complicated or personalized. Trying to change the code often led to errors or unnecessary complexity. For more advanced tasks, like improving design or adding special features, the AI just isn’t enough.

The design it created was plain and lacked any real style. It worked, but it wasn’t something I’d call professional. This made me realize that while the AI can handle small tasks, it isn’t a substitute for real programmers or designers.

Another issue was trying to generate a PDF of the full conversation. What seemed like a simple task turned out to be much harder than expected, showing the AI’s limits in handling such things smoothly.

In the end, this experiment showed me that AI can be useful for quick, simple jobs, but it’s not good enough for complex or creative projects. I wouldn’t try it again for anything larger because it didn’t meet my expectations for more detailed work.
